// Closures succinctly capture variables from enclosing scopes. Does this have any consequences? It
// surely does.  Observe how using a closure as a function parameter requires generics, which is
// necessary because of how they are defined:
//
// 'F' must be generic.
// fn apply<F>(f: F) where F: FnOnce() { 
//     f();
// }

// When a closure is defined, the compiler implicitly creates a new anonymous structure to store
// the captured variables inside, meanwhile implementing the functionality via one of the traits:
// Fn, FnMut, or FnOnce for this unknown type.  This type is assigned to the variable which is
// stored until calling.
//
// Since this new type is of unknown type, any usage in a function will require generics.  However,
// an unbounded type parameter <T> would still be ambiguous and not be allowed.  This, bounding by
// one of the traits: Fn, FnMut, or FnOnce (which it implements) is sufficient to specify its type.

// 'F' must implement 'Fn' for a closure which takes no inputs and returns nothing - exactly what
// is required for 'print'.
fn apply<F>(f: F) where F: Fn() {
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 7;
    // Capture 'x' into an anonymous type and implement 'Fn' for it.  Store it in 'print'.
    let print = || println!("{}", x);
    apply(print);
}
