// Since closures may be used as arguments, you might wonder if the same can be said about
// functions.  And indeed they can! If you declare a function that takes a closure as parameter,
// then any function that satisfies that trait bound of that closure can be passed as a parameter.
//
// Define a function which takes a generic 'F' argument bounded by 'Fn', an calls it
fn call_me<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    f();
}

// Define a wrapper function satisfying the 'Fn' bound
fn function() {
    println!("I'm a function!");
}

fn main() {
    // Define a closure satisfying the 'Fn' bound
    let closure = || println!("I'm a closure!");

    call_me(closure);
    call_me(function);
}

// As an additional note, the Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce traits dictate how a closure captures variables
// from the enclosing scope.
