Some topics aren't exactly relevant to how you program but provide you tooling
or infrastructure support which just makes things better for everyone.  The
topics include:

  - Documentation: Generate library documentation for users via the included
    _rustdoc_.
  - _Playpen_: Integrate the Rust Playpen (also known as the Rust Playground) in
    your documentation.
